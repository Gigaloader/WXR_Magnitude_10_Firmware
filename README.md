How to flash the firmware:

1. Turn off printer. Remove micro-sd card from the mainboard on the bottom of the printer. (Not the SD card at the LCD screen slot)
2. Plug in the mirco-sd to your computer. (You probably need an adapter)
3. Delete the old firmware.cur from the card and copy and paste the new firmware.bin file
4. Eject micro-sd card from your computer.
5. Insert the micro-sd card back into the mainboard on the printer.
6. Turn on printer. The firmware will flash automatically. (If you get an eeprom error at first start up, clean the eeprom with a M502 command in the terminal)
7. Run first layer calibration if needed.

8. Done!
